[2016-04-15] ToDo List
======================

Fireball is undergoing an active transtion into a more robust
efficient and developer friendly design. 

This a list of tasks that are currently on development.

   1. Fdata will be changed from a set of text-based files into a
      single HDF5 file. Efficiency will be gained from faster access to
      the data, directly stored in binary format. Storage is also reduced
      and tools will be added to access the contents stored in the new format.

      During the transition time, the current scheme will coexists with the new
      binary format. The old format will be deprecated and will eventually disapear
      in a future release.

      Fireball will start being dependent of HDF5 libraries. Widely available on
      many HPC infraestructures.


   2. The parallelization on Fireball will receive a complete new design:
      We are considering implement a Hybrid model of parallelization
      including MPI, OpenMP and Accelerators (GPU and Xeon Phi).
      
      Most of the current pragmas will disapear and users are advised of using the
      pure serial compilation util paralelization developemnts beign complete
      and tuning performed.

   3. A new Test Suite is under development including test to ensure functionality
      in the long term and allowing a consistent Code Coverage for the sources.

   4. Explain Fork and Pull requests to members
